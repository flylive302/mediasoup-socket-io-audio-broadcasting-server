## 1. Connection Setup

### Socket.IO Client Configuration

```typescript
import { io, Socket } from "socket.io-client";

const socket: Socket = io("wss://audio.flylive.app", {
  auth: {
    token: jwtToken, // JWT from Laravel
  },
  transports: ["websocket"], // WebSocket only, no polling fallback
  reconnection: true,
  reconnectionAttempts: 5,
  reconnectionDelay: 1000,
});
```

### Connection Lifecycle

```
Connect → Authenticate (JWT) → Join Room → Create Transport → Produce/Consume Audio
```

| Step | Event/Method        | Purpose                                    |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | `io()` connect      | Establish WebSocket + JWT auth             |
| 2    | `room:join`         | Join audio room, get RTP capabilities      |
| 3    | `transport:create`  | Create WebRTC producer/consumer transports |
| 4    | `transport:connect` | DTLS handshake                             |
| 5    | `audio:produce`     | Start sending audio                        |
| 6    | `audio:consume`     | Start receiving audio from others          |

---

## 2. Authentication

### JWT Structure

The JWT is issued by Laravel and contains user data. MSAB validates it with a shared HMAC-SHA256 secret.

```typescript
// JWT payload structure (embedded in token)
interface JwtPayload {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  signature: string;
  email: string;
  avatar: string;
  frame: string;
  gender: number; // integer (0=male, 1=female, etc.)
  date_of_birth: string; // ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  phone: string;
  country: string;
  coins: string;
  diamonds: string;
  wealth_xp: string;
  charm_xp: string;
  is_blocked: boolean;
  isSpeaker: boolean;
  exp: number; // Expiration timestamp
}
```

> **Note**: `gender` is an integer matching the Laravel DB value.

### Connection Events

```typescript
socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("Connected to MSAB");
});

socket.on("connect_error", (err) => {
  // Common: "Invalid credentials" = JWT invalid/expired
  console.error("Connection failed:", err.message);
});

socket.on("disconnect", (reason) => {
  // "io server disconnect" = server kicked (blocked user, etc.)
  // "transport close" = network issue
  console.log("Disconnected:", reason);
});
```

---

## 3. Event Patterns

### Pattern 1: Emit with Acknowledgment (Request/Response)

Used for events that return data. The server calls back with a response.

```typescript
// Emit and wait for server response
const response = await socket.emitWithAck("room:join", {
  roomId: "42",
  ownerId: 1234,
});

if (response.error) {
  throw new Error(response.error);
}

// Use response data
const { rtpCapabilities, participants, seats } = response;
```

**Events using this pattern**: `room:join`, `transport:create`, `transport:connect`, `audio:produce`, `audio:consume`, `consumer:resume`, `seat:take`, `seat:assign`, `seat:remove`, `seat:mute`, `seat:unmute`, `seat:lock`, `seat:unlock`, `seat:invite`, `user:getRoom`

### Pattern 2: Fire-and-Forget

Used for events that don't need a response. Server processes silently.

```typescript
// Emit without waiting for response
socket.emit("chat:message", {
  roomId: "42",
  content: "Hello everyone!",
});

socket.emit("gift:send", {
  roomId: "42",
  giftId: 5,
  recipientId: 123,
  quantity: 1,
});
```

**Events using this pattern**: `chat:message`, `gift:send`, `gift:prepare`, `room:leave`, `seat:leave`

### Pattern 3: Listen for Broadcasts

Used for receiving server-pushed events.

```typescript
// Listen for broadcasts from server
socket.on("room:userJoined", (payload) => {
  participants.value.push(payload);
});

socket.on("seat:updated", (payload) => {
  updateSeat(payload.seatIndex, payload.user, payload.isMuted);
});

socket.on("gift:received", (payload) => {
  playGiftAnimation(payload.giftId);
});
```

**All S→C events**: `room:userJoined`, `room:userLeft`, `room:closed`, `audio:newProducer`, `speaker:active`, `seat:updated`, `seat:cleared`, `seat:locked`, `seat:userMuted`, `seat:invite-received`, `seat:invite-pending`, `chat:message`, `gift:received`, `gift:error`

## 5. TypeScript Types

### User Object

The user object appears in many payloads (`room:join` response, `room:userJoined` broadcast, `seat:updated` broadcast).

```typescript
/** User data as received from MSAB in event payloads */
interface MsabUser {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  signature: string;
  avatar: string;
  frame: string;
  gender: number;
  country: string;
  wealth_xp: number;
  charm_xp: number;
  isSpeaker: boolean;
}
```

### Room Join Response

```typescript
/** Response from `room:join` acknowledgment */
interface RoomJoinResponse {
  rtpCapabilities: RtpCapabilities; // mediasoup types
  participants: MsabUser[];
  seats: SeatState[];
  lockedSeats: number[];
  existingProducers: { producerId: string; userId: number }[];
}
```

### Seat State

```typescript
/** Seat state as received in `room:join` and `seat:updated` */
interface SeatState {
  seatIndex: number;
  user: MsabUser;
  isMuted: boolean;
}
```

### Chat Message

```typescript
/** Payload for `chat:message` broadcast */
interface ChatMessagePayload {
  content: string;
  type?: string;
  user: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    avatar: string;
    signature: string;
    frame: string;
    gender: number;
    country: string;
    wealth_xp: number;
    charm_xp: number;
  };
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Gift Received

```typescript
/** Payload for `gift:received` broadcast */
interface GiftReceivedPayload {
  senderId: number;
  senderName: string;
  senderAvatar: string;
  roomId: string;
  recipientId: number;
  giftId: number;
  quantity: number;
}
```

---

## 6. Error Handling

### Error Response Shape

All ACK events return errors in the same shape:

```typescript
interface MsabErrorResponse {
  error: string;
}

// Usage
const response = await socket.emitWithAck("event:name", payload);
if ("error" in response) {
  handleError(response.error);
}
```

### Common Errors

| Error Message           | Cause                       | Resolution                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `"Invalid credentials"` | JWT expired or malformed    | Refresh JWT from Laravel         |
| `"Invalid payload"`     | Zod validation failed       | Check payload matches schema     |
| `"Internal error"`      | Server exception            | Retry or report bug              |
| `"Not on seat"`         | Seat operation without seat | Check seat state first           |
| `"Seat occupied"`       | Taking occupied seat        | Choose different seat            |
| `"Rate limited"`        | Too many messages/gifts     | Wait before retrying             |
| `"Not authorized"`      | Missing owner permissions   | Only room owner can mutate seats |

### Silent Drops

Some events silently drop invalid requests (no error returned):

| Event          | Drop Condition                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `chat:message` | Invalid payload or rate limited |
| `gift:send`    | Invalid payload or rate limited |

---

## 7. State Sync Strategy

### Initial State (on `room:join`)

When joining a room, the ACK response contains the complete room state:

```typescript
const state = await socket.emitWithAck("room:join", { roomId, ownerId });

// Populate all local state from this response
participants.value = state.participants;
seats.value = state.seats;
lockedSeats.value = state.lockedSeats;
producers.value = state.existingProducers;
rtpCapabilities.value = state.rtpCapabilities;
```

### Incremental Updates (via broadcasts)

After joining, keep state in sync via broadcasts:

| State        | Add/Update Event    | Remove Event           |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Participants | `room:userJoined`   | `room:userLeft`        |
| Seats        | `seat:updated`      | `seat:cleared`         |
| Locked Seats | `seat:locked`       | `seat:locked` (toggle) |
| Producers    | `audio:newProducer` | `room:userLeft`        |
| Chat         | `chat:message`      | (append only)          |

### Room Lifecycle

```
room:join → [interact] → room:leave
                ↓             ↓
          room:closed    disconnect
```

- Always listen for `room:closed` to handle server-side room closure
- On `disconnect`, clean up mediasoup transports and rejoin on reconnect

---

## 8. Debugging Tips

### Enable Socket.IO Debug Logs

```typescript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem("debug", "socket.io-client:*");
```

### Event Tracing Checklist

1. **Connection issues**: Check JWT expiration, verify JWT payload matches `UserSchema`
2. **Missing broadcasts**: Verify `socket.join(roomId)` succeeded (check `room:join` ACK)
3. **Audio issues**: Ensure `transport:create` → `transport:connect` → `audio:produce/consume` sequence
4. **Seat errors**: Only room owner (`ownerId`) can assign/remove/mute/lock seats

### Useful Server Events for Debugging

| Event               | What It Tells You                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `room:userJoined`   | Your join was successful (others receive this)           |
| `audio:newProducer` | Audio is being produced (consume this producer)          |
| `gift:error`        | Gift failed on Laravel side (insufficient balance, etc.) |
